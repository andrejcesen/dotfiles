## Bootstrap a clean macOS

Run `script/bootstrap.sh`. This will install `brew` (if it's not found) and proceed to install all packages, along with switching over to `fish` shell.

It should also run the Neovim first time setup and fetch all of the plugins for you automatically. Once done you can execute the sync fish function to update brew and the Neovim plugins.
